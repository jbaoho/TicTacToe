# TicTacToe

This repository is a tic tac toe game designed to be played between a human player and the computer. The code consists of a GUI made using the pygame API and an AI made using the Minimax algorithm. The tic tac toe board was represented in the program by a 3-by-3 matrix which allowed the AI algorithm to be informed on the player's moves and make the best decision based on the most recently played move.
